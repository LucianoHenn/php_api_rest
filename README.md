# php_api_rest
REST API in PHP without any framework


In order to run the project you have to download the whole project and save it into a folder called "api_rest" inside htdocs.

Then you have to import the database directly from the file "rest_api_demo.sql". After that you have to set your local db credentials in
the config.php file inside the inc folder.

Now you are ready to go!
